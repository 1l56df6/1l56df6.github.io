Browser client for Eagler 1.8.8-u29. There is now a singleplayer in this client, and LAN works the same way as it did in 1.5.2. Updated regularly as Lax1dude has resumed development.

Server has to run locally on user's PC (or anywhere else). All credit for my eaglercraft projects goes to lax1dude for writing the eagler javascript runtime and the built in shader pack.

There will soon be major changes as I prepeare to upgrade and migrate all of my clients and servers to 1.8.

## Running
#### Look at [https://github.com/catfoolyou/EaglerX-Server](https://github.com/catfoolyou/EaglerX-Server) for instructions on LAN servers.

Current server replit: https://replit.com/@catfoolyougithu/eaglercraft-server

How to run:
1) Fork the repl
2) Go to the Cubernite folder and delete `world`, `world_nether` and `world_the_end` (this is mandatory)
3) Run the repl
4) Copy the adderesses from https://replit.com/@yourusername/eaglercraft-server?v=1 AND from https://eaglercraft-server.yourusername.repl.co/ (replace `yourusername` with your actual replit username)
5) In the client set up servers for both addresses
6) Join either server

### If it lags, use the offline HTML file instead of the browser client.

## No Replit? No problem.
If for some reason you are unable to connect to the Replit server, or it is blocked.
